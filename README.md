# Exponential distribution simulations

In this assignment for the class on Models and Simulation (UNC - 2020) we had to code models of the Exponential Probability Distribution and
simulate examples using it, as well as visualizations of the simulations.
The exponential distribution is on of the many probability continuous distributions of time between events.
